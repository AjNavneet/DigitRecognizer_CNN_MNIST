# MNIST Digit Recognizer using CNN

## Overview

This project aims to create a Handwritten Digit Recognizer using deep learning techniques. We will leverage the MNIST dataset, a widely recognized database of handwritten digits. 

## Objective

Our goal is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately classify and identify handwritten digits.

---

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset comprises a training set of 60,000 handwritten digit examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each image in the dataset is associated with a label that represents the correct digit it depicts. For example, an image of the handwritten digit "3" is labeled as "3."

## Tech Stack
- Language: `python`
- Libraries: `tensorflow` , `numpy` , `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: We will preprocess the dataset, including reshaping the data, converting labels to categorical format, and performing feature scaling.

2. **Model Creation**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model will be constructed for digit recognition. The model architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.

3. **Training**: We will train the CNN model using the training set, allowing it to learn and recognize patterns in handwritten digits.

4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance will be evaluated on the test set, and metrics such as loss and accuracy will be assessed.

5. **Prediction**: The trained model will be used to make predictions on new, unseen handwritten digit images.
